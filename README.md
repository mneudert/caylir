# Caylir

Cayley driver for Elixir

## Cayley Support

Tested cayley versions:

- `0.7.0`
- `0.7.1`
- `0.7.2`
- `0.7.3`
- `0.7.4`

(see
[`.travis.yml`](https://github.com/mneudert/caylir/blob/master/.travis.yml)
to be sure)

## Package Setup

Add caylir as a dependency to your `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    # ...
    {:caylir, "~> 0.9"},
    # ...
  ]
end
```

## Application Setup

### Graph Definition

Defining a graph connection requires defining a module:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.MyGraph do
  use Caylir.Graph, otp_app: :my_app
end
```

The `:otp_app` name and the name of the module can be freely chosen but have to
be linked to a corresponding configuration entry. This defined graph module
needs to be hooked up into your supervision tree:

```elixir
children = [
  # ...
  MyApp.MyGraph,
  # ...
]
```

### Configuration (static)

The most simple way is to use a completely static configuration:

```elixir
config :my_app, MyApp.MyGraph,
  host: "localhost",
  pool: [max_overflow: 10, size: 50],
  port: 64210
```

### Configuration (dynamic)

If you cannot, for whatever reason, use a static application config you can
configure an initializer module that will be called every time your graph
is started (or restarted) in your supervision tree:

```elixir
config :my_app, MyApp.MyGraph,
  init: {MyInitModule, :my_init_fun}

defmodule MyInitModule do
  @spec my_init_fun(module) :: :ok
  def my_init_fun(graph) do
    config =
      Keyword.merge(
        graph.config(),
        host: "localhost",
        port: 64210
      )

    Application.put_env(:my_app, graph, config)
  end
end
```

When the graph is started the function will be called with the graph module
as the first (and only) parameter. This will be done before the graph is
available for use.

The function is expected to always return `:ok`.

### Configuration (inline defaults)

For some use cases (e.g. testing) it may be sufficient to define hardcoded
configuration defaults outside of your application environment:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.MyGraph do
  use Caylir.Graph,
    otp_app: :my_app,
    config: [
      host: "localhost",
      port: 64210
    ]
end
```

These values will be overwritten by and/or merged with the
application environment values when the configuration is accessed.

## Usage

Writing Data:

```elixir
# single quad
MyApp.MyGraph.write(%{
  subject: "graph",
  predicate: "connection",
  object: "target"
})

# multiple quads (bulk write)
MyApp.MyGraph.write([quad_1, quad_2])
```

Querying data:

```elixir
# Gizmo syntax!
query = "graph.Vertex('graph').Out('connection').All()"

# Default result limit
MyApp.MyGraph.query(query)

# Custom result limit (limited + unlimited)
MyApp.MyGraph.query(query, limit: 3)
MyApp.MyGraph.query(query, limit: -1)
```

Deleting Data:

```elixir
# single quad
MyApp.MyGraph.delete(%{
  subject: "graph",
  predicate: "connection",
  object: "target"
})

# multiple quads (bulk delete)
MyApp.MyGraph.delete([quad_1, quad_2])
```

### JSON Configuration

By default the library used for encoding/decoding JSON is `:poison`. For the
time `:caylir` directly depends on it to ensure it is available.

If you want to use another library you can switch it:

```elixir
config :my_app, MyGraph,
  json_decoder: MyJSONLibrary,
  json_encoder: MyJSONLibrary

config :my_app, MyGraph,
  json_decoder: {MyJSONLibrary, :decode_it, [:foo]},
  json_encoder: {MyJSONLibrary, :encode_it, [:bar]}
```

If you configure only a module name it will be called as
`module.decode!(map)` and `module.encode!(map)`. When using a complete
`{m, f, a}` configuration the data to decode/encode will passed as the
first argument with your configured extra arguments following.

### Query Language Configuration

If you are using a query language other than the default `:gizmo` you
can configure your graph to use a different endpoint:

```elixir
config :my_app, MyApp.MyGraph,
  language: :graphql
```

### Query Limit Configuration

You can define a default query limit by adding it to your graph config:

```elixir
config :my_app, MyApp.MyGraph,
  limit: -1
```

### Query Timeout Configuration

Using all default values and no specific parameters each query is allowed to
take up to 5000 milliseconds (`GenServer.call/2` timeout) to complete.
That may be too long or not long enough in some cases.

To change that timeout you can configure your graph:

```elixir
# lowering timeout to 500 ms
config :my_app, MyApp.MyGraph,
  query_timeout: 500
```

or pass an individual timeout for a single query:

```elixir
MyApp.MyGraph.query(query, timeout: 250)
```

A passed or graph wide timeout configuration override any `:recv_timeout`
of your `:hackney` (HTTP client) configuration.

This does not apply to write requests. They are currently only affected by
configured `:recv_timeout` values. Setting a graph timeout enables you to
have a different timeout for read and write requests.

For the underlying worker pool you can define a separate timeout:

```elixir
config :my_app, MyApp.MyGraph,
  pool_timeout: 500
```

This configuration will be used to wait for an available worker to execute a
query and defaults to `5_000`.
