# Changelog

## v0.9.0-dev

- Enhancements
    - Compiling a graph module without passing an `:otp_app` will now raise
    - Graphs can be declared with compile time configuration defaults
      that are later overwritten by the application environment

      and will stop working in a future release

## v0.8.0 (2018-09-09)

- Enhancements
    - Configuration can be done on graph (re-) start by setting a

      called with the graph module name as the first (and only) parameter
      and is expected to return `:ok`

    - Support for elixir 1.5 style `child_spec` has been added

      removed from the documentation. It will eventually be removed completely
      after a proper deprecation phase
